# Heart Attack Risk Prediction

This project aims to analyze health data and predict the risk of heart attacks using machine learning models. The dataset contains various attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other health metrics.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `python_Project.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `heart_attack_risk_dataset.csv` — Dataset with health-related features for heart attack risk prediction.

## 🔍 Features in the Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:
- **age**: Age of the patient
- **sex**: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
- **cp**: Chest pain type (categorical)
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise
- **slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy
- **thal**: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
- **target**: 1 = risk of heart attack, 0 = no risk

## 📊 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualization of feature distributions
   - Correlation matrix heatmap
   - Target vs feature analysis

3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

## ✅ Results

- Model comparison is done based on accuracy and other classification metrics.
- Best-performing model is highlighted based on evaluation results.
